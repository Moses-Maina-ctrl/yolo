# Objectives

## Objective 1: Choice of Base Image
- For the frontend and backend the base image chosen was **node:13.12-alpine**. This was chosen because the newer versions of node did not support the some of the older dependencies and caused the container to immediately stop when ran.
- Node version 13.2.0 supported the older dependencies and the containers ran successfully.
- The **Alpine** version of node was chosen due to its lightweight

- For the database **mongo:latest** was used and the app was able to connect successfully.

## Objective 2: Dockerfile Directives

## Objective 3: Docker-compose Networking and volumes

## Objective 4: Running of the Application

## Objective 5:  Dockerhub
